# Welcome to Naive!

**Naive** is a modern, configurable text editor created to help you edit files
without a hassle. Built for programmers, Naive offers syntax highlighting,
project management, and more.

Soon, Naive will support different keybindings, regular expression
search-and-replace, and command line tool integration.

Naive is currently migrating to a different highlighting system, so there are
some known bugs that occur when the user edits text.

Naive is an open-source project
[on Github](https://github.com/thomasebsmith/naive), made by Thomas Smith.
